        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: white">Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002
                as a family owned and operated business. The Gym and Fitness founders didn’t want it to
                be just another gym equipment retailer - they wanted to be the best in the industry and
                set their minds to doing so! Since its birth, Gym and Fitness has grown into one of
                Australia’s largest online fitness equipment retailers having helped over 50,000
                customers live longer, happier and healthier lives</span></p>
